# CodeClauseInternship_Flight-Delay-Prediction-Model
Airline delay prediction in Python

The objective of the project is to perform analysis of the historic flight data to gain valuable insights and build a predictive model to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not

The objective of the predictive model is to build a model to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not based on certain characteristics of the flight

The output whether the flight is delayed or not depends on the time; if the flight is late by 15 minutes or more then it is declared as delayed.
